# Welcome to MkDocs

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](http://mkdocs.org).

## Purpose

To summerize the purpose of this site: 
> I needed something to get rid of my forgetfulness and usual "going-straigth-to-the-goal-without-nowing-what-you-did-and-what-it-does" type of working/getting into things. - <i>Broder Peters, 27th January 2018, 12:01AM (UTC+1)</i>

First I thought about just writing stuff on paper. But paper isn't eternal and I need to carry it around all the time.
Regarding this consideration I decided to use a sort of online documentation tool to catch my stuff up.

## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs help` - Print this help message.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
